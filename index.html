            <h1>This is my first web interface project</h1>
            <p>Chanterelle is the common name of several species of fungi in the genera Cantharellus, Craterellus,
                Gomphus, and Polyozellus. They are among the most popular of wild edible mushrooms. They are orange,
                yellow or white, meaty and funnel-shaped. On the lower surface, underneath the smooth cap, most species
                have rounded, forked folds that run almost all the way down the stipe, which tapers down seamlessly from
                the cap. Many species emit a fruity aroma, reminiscent of apricots, and often have a mildly peppery
                taste (hence its German name, Pfifferling). The name chanterelle originates from the Greek kantharos
                meaning "tankard" or "cup", a reference to their general shape</p>

            <h1>Oyster Mushroom</h1>
            <p>Pleurotus ostreatus, the oyster mushroom, oyster fungus, hiratake, or pearl oyster mushroom is a common edible mushroom.[2] It was first cultivated in Germany as a subsistence measure during World War I[3] and is now grown commercially around the world for food. It is related to the similarly cultivated king oyster mushroom. Oyster mushrooms can also be used industrially for mycoremediation purposes.
                The oyster mushroom is one of the more commonly sought wild mushrooms, though it can also be cultivated on straw and other media. It has the bittersweet aroma of benzaldehyde (which is also characteristic of bitter almonds)</p>

            <p>A perpetual stew, also known as forever soup, hunter's pot[1][2] or hunter's stew, is a pot into which whatever foodstuffs one can find is placed and cooked. The pot is never or rarely emptied all the way, and ingredients and liquid are replenished as necessary.[1][3] Such foods can continue cooking for decades or longer, if properly maintained. The concept is often a common element in descriptions of medieval inns. Foods prepared in a perpetual stew have been described as being flavorful due to the manner in which the ingredients blend together.

            <h1>Ploughman's Lunch</h1>
            <p>A ploughman's lunch is an English cold meal based around bread, cheese, and fresh or pickled onions.[1] Additional items can be added such as ham, green salad, hard boiled eggs, and apple, and usual accompaniments are butter and "pickle", which in Britain denotes a chutney-like condiment.[2] As its name suggests, it is most commonly eaten at lunchtime. It is particularly associated with pubs, and often served with beer
