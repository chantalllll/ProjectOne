            <p>Bats are a diverse group of mammals ranging from insectivores to vampires. Some pollinate flowers and
                some dive in lakes and ponds to catch fish
                They're found all over the world and fall into their own niche category. 1/3 of all mammals are aviators
                because there are more than 1,300 different species of bat
                In fact, bats are apart of their own familial group, chiroptera, meaning theyre not part of any other
                animal family.
            </p>
            <p>Bats use echolocation to find prey and other bats. contrary to popular belief, bats aren't blind, but
                they do have poor eyesight.

            <p>Chanterelle is the common name of several species of fungi in the genera Cantharellus, Craterellus,
                Gomphus, and Polyozellus. They are among the most popular of wild edible mushrooms. They are orange,
                yellow or white, meaty and funnel-shaped. On the lower surface, underneath the smooth cap, most species
                have rounded, forked folds that run almost all the way down the stipe, which tapers down seamlessly from
                the cap. Many species emit a fruity aroma, reminiscent of apricots, and often have a mildly peppery
                taste (hence its German name, Pfifferling). The name chanterelle originates from the Greek kantharos
                meaning "tankard" or "cup", a reference to their general shape</p>
